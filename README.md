# Environment Setup for Technical Analysis and Backtesting

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up `numpy`, `ta-lib`, and `backtesting.py`, along with an automated `Makefile` for easy installation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Administrative privileges (for some installation steps)

---

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install `numpy`
Ensure you have `numpy` version 1.26.3 installed, as itâ€™s compatible with `pandas_ta`.

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.3


# Install TA-Lib

TA-Lib is a library for technical analysis, required by pandas_ta for specific indicators. Follow these steps to install it from source.

Step 2.1: Download the TA-Lib Source Code
Use wget to download the source tar file:

bash
Copia codice
wget https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
Step 2.2: Extract the Archive
Unpack the downloaded file:

bash
Copia codice
tar -xvf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib/
Step 2.3: Build and Install
Configure, make, and install TA-Lib. This may require administrative privileges.

bash
Copia codice
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

3. Install backtesting.py
The backtesting.py library allows for flexible backtesting of strategies based on technical indicators.

Step 3.1: Clone the Repository
Clone the backtesting.py repository:

bash
Copia codice
git clone https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py
Step 3.2: Install backtesting.py
Navigate to the cloned repository and install:

bash
Copia codice
cd backtesting.py
pip install .
Automated Setup with Makefile
To simplify the setup, a Makefile is provided. This file will automate the installation of numpy, ta-lib, and backtesting.py.

Makefile
makefile
Copia codice
# Makefile for setting up numpy, ta-lib, and backtesting.py

# Variables
NUMPY_VERSION=1.26.3
TALIB_VERSION=0.4.0
TALIB_URL=https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)-src.tar.gz
BACKTESTING_REPO=https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py

# Default target
all: numpy ta-lib backtesting

# Install numpy with a specific version
numpy:
	pip install numpy==$(NUMPY_VERSION)

# Download and install TA-Lib from source
ta-lib: ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)/lib/libta_lib.a

ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)/lib/libta_lib.a:
	@echo "Downloading and installing TA-Lib..."
	wget $(TALIB_URL)
	tar -xvf ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)-src.tar.gz
	cd ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION) && ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install
	rm -f ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)-src.tar.gz

# Clone and install backtesting.py
backtesting:
	@if [ ! -d "backtesting.py" ]; then \
		echo "Cloning backtesting.py repository..."; \
		git clone $(BACKTESTING_REPO); \
	fi
	cd backtesting.py && pip install .

# Clean up downloaded files and directories
clean:
	rm -rf ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION) ta-lib-$(TALIB_VERSION)-src.tar.gz
	rm -rf backtesting.py

# Phony targets
.PHONY: all numpy ta-lib backtesting clean
How to Use the Makefile
To run the full setup (installing numpy, ta-lib, and backtesting.py):

bash
Copia codice
make
To clean up any downloaded files or cloned repositories:

bash
Copia codice
make clean
Verification
After completing these steps, verify that all components were installed correctly by running:

python
Copia codice
import numpy as np
import talib
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
If no errors occur, the setup is complete.
