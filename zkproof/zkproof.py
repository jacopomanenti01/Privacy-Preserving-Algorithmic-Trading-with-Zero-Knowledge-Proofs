# Input: Private data (e.g., df['close'] for RSI calculation or features for prediction).
# Computation: Perform the calculations (e.g., RSI or prediction logic).
# Output: A proof that the computation is correct without revealing the input data.

# 1. Store the Model Hash on the Blockchain
# Instead of storing the full model, store a cryptographic hash of the model on the blockchain.
# When loading the model, recompute its hash and compare it to the stored hash to verify integrity.
